What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You create a .git file containing history metadata
	allows for change-tracking

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	working directory is the source of all relevant files
	staging area is where immediately relevant (ie to be committed) files go.
	Repository is where they go once committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	check git status to see which files are in staging area
	if there are any that aren’t part of this one logical change, remove with git reset

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	I’m probably gonna branch like a maniac. It’s always helpful if you’re indecisive. 
	Also, though, when taking risks, or making slightly different versions (e.g. easy mode for a game) 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	By showing you which branch you’re on and which parents you have you can understand what will happen when you commit - i.e. what the impact of adding commits will be
	Additionally, you can see what won’t be included in your branch’s history (i.e. what changes have been made and not incorporated) and which branches will be unaffected by changes
