When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  in cases: computer issues (so project isn't lost with hard drive)
  collaboration - multiple people on multiple devices - best way to work together
  multiple devices - to work on the same project from different devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	if u need to have a public, working version, while working privately on a less stable build
	if u want your most current build to be private & not free and are down to leave another build free
	because you’re not always connected to remote repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - when building on another GitHub user’s work
	clone - any other time you need a copy
	branch - when making changes you won’t /mightn’t incorporate into main branch
