When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  in cases: computer issues (so project isn't lost with hard drive)
  collaboration - multiple people on multiple devices - best way to work together
  multiple devices - to work on the same project from different devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	if u need to have a public, working version, while working privately on a less stable build
	if u want your most current build to be private & not free and are down to leave another build free
	because youâ€™re not always connected to remote repo
