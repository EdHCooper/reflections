When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	in cases: computer issues (so project isn't lost with hard drive)
  	collaboration - multiple people on multiple devices - best way to work 		together
  	multiple devices - to work on the same project from different devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	if u need to have a public, working version, while working privately on a 		less stable build
	if u want your most current build to be private & not free and are down to 		leave another build free
	because you’re not always connected to remote repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - when building on another GitHub user’s work
	clone - any other time you need a copy
	branch - when making changes you won’t /mightn’t incorporate into main branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Allows you to work with it even if you’re then offline.
	Allows you to work on making your commits merge properly with the last commit 	of the remote, so you can merge with that commit eventually even if someone 	made changes to it (added commits) since then- yours would get incorporated 	into the version before theirs, which might allow you to then merge the 		merged version with the updated remote version if it gets updated in the 		interim

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Nothing, everything.
